# Features  for Google Cloud

## Objective

Enhancing Serverless Functionality for Enterprise Customers

## Summary

As businesses increasingly adopt serverless architecture to drive innovation and efficiency, meeting the diverse needs of enterprise customers becomes paramount. The following enhancements are proposed to elevate the serverless experience of Google Cloud Function based on the user requirements and competitors offerings.

## Google Cloud Functions

1. **Execution time limit can be increased** based on the pricing plan, to support enterprise customer requirements of allowing for longer-running functions and more complex workloads.
2. Implement **provisioned concurrency** to mitigate cold starts, ensuring faster function initialization and improved performance for latency-sensitive applications.  
3. **Implement blue-green deployments** for serverless functions to enable gradual traffic shifting and provide a robust rollback plan, ensuring seamless updates and minimizing potential disruptions to end-users.
4. **Introduce custom CPU and memory configurations** for premium plans to cater to enterprise customers with specific performance requirements. This flexibility allows businesses to optimize their serverless functions for resource-intensive workloads and improve overall application performance.

## Google Firestore

1. **Evaluate pay-per-request pricing model** for Firestore to better support scalable applications. This pricing structure would allow customers to pay only for the resources they actually use, making it more cost-effective for applications with varying workloads and improving overall scalability.
2. **Implement native event streaming** for Firestore, similar to DynamoDB streams, to support event-driven architectures. This feature would allow real-time data changes to be captured and processed, enabling developers to build responsive, scalable applications that can react to data modifications instantly.
